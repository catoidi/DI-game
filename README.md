# DI: Debt is Inevitable (Source Code)
This repository contains data for my upcoming game, DI: Debt is Inevitable, made in GZDOOM.

This only includes the data that falls under the "GPLv3" License. See "LICENSE" for more info.

This repository alone is not enough to play DI. What's included here is mostly zscript/acs code, and does not include the graphics/audio/levels required for the game to function.

The game is planned to be released in 2024.

### Here's some other repos designed to work with DI:
- **DI-assets:** Not available for public consumption.
- [DI-bonus:](https://github.com/catoidi/DI-bonus) An example addon meant to help modders add custom content to the game.
- [DI-hdfont:](https://github.com/catoidi/DI-hdfont) Optional addon that adds higher resolution fonts to DI. Can aid making text easier to read.
- [gearbox:](https://github.com/catoidi/gearbox) A modified version of the "gearbox" mod intended to work with DI.

### This code also contains (modified!) versions of the following repos:

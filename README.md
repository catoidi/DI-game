# DI: Debt is Inevitable (Source Code)
This repository contains data for my upcoming game, DI: Debt is Inevitable, made in GZDOOM.

This only includes the data that falls under the "GPLv3" License. See "LICENSE" for more info.

This repository alone is not enough to play DI. What's included here is mostly zscript/acs code, and does not include the graphics/audio/levels required for the game to function.

The game is planned to be released in 2025.

### Here's some other repos designed to work with DI:
- **DI-content:** Contains assets for DI that do not fall under an open source license. Included with a retail copy of the game.
- **DI-music:** Addon that contains the music files for DI. Included with a retail copy of the game.
- [gearbox:](https://github.com/catoidi/gearbox) A modified version of the "gearbox" mod intended to work with DI.

### This code also contains (modified!) versions of the following repos:

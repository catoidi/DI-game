# DI-game
This repository contains data for my upcoming game, DI, made in GZDOOM.

This only includes the data that falls under the "GPLv3" License. See "LICENSE" for more info.

This repository alone is not enough to play DI. You also need a file called "di-data.pk3", which is not included here.

This repo also includes modified versions of libraries from other creators. I'll update this README in the future with more info for that.
